# Mini Projet du Cours Programmation
 Yuchen and Chenyin, as two Python beginners, we've realized together this mini programming project. 
 Generally, we wrote a simple tool for better processing the Excel Data by Python.
 As the sample data base for this programming exercise, we used an Excel database about the second-hand car transactions in Guangdong Province, China.
 Firstly, we've practiced how to read data, display data and then cleanup the data.
 After of that, we tried to do the data pretreatment, data extraction, data screening, data summary and data statistics.
 And here is our output.
